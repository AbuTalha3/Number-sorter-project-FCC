This project will help you understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how you can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications. 

<code>const bubbleSort = (array) => {
  const n = array.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {
      if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
        // Swap elements
        let temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j + 1];
        array[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
}

const numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2];
console.log(bubbleSort(numbers)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]</code>
